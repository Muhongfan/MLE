# Data Exploration:

## Summary Statistics:
Calculate basic statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and quantiles for pixel values in the images. This helps to understand the distribution of pixel intensities.

## Visualization:
Plot histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the distribution of pixel values, identify potential outliers, and understand the relationships between features.

## Image Visualization:
Display a random subset of images to visually inspect the quality, size, and content. This can help identify any data quality issues or variations.
